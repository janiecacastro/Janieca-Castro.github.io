        <p>Using the arduino uno to connect to a temperature sensor that sends a signal that triggers the LED light and sends a notification to the phone. </p>

	    <p>For this final project i decided to try to create a temperature sensore for a 
fishtank or a tank surviving animal, that has special temperature rquirements for its survival. 
I did research and learned that different types of fish (fresh water, salt water) have not only 
different temperature requirements but also has different lighting requirements, some having to spend 
8 hours a day to 18 hours a day in sunlight where as some fish thrive beter in mostly darkness. 
So the idea behind my project was to create a device that continuously checks the water temperature 
of the tank to make sure its set to the requirements of your specific species of fish. When the water 
gets too cold the sensor senda a popup notification to your phone to alert you it will be turning on 
		    the led light to help warm the tank. </p>
