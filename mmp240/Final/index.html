                <p>I am currently a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College with a pending  Associate of Science Degree in Multimedia programming and design in June 2020. I began studying visual communication arts in High school where I became adobe certified. My main interests is Art and I love any aspect of art whether its painting, sculpting, digital media and beyond. I have my own Design studio where I do freelance work. I have advanced Adobe Illustrator and Indesign skills as well as I enjoy digitally drawing images on my tablet using Procreate and Adobe Fresco. I also have intermediate coding skills in Html/Html5/CSS. I am also intermediate in Wire framing and prototyping apps and websites.  I am also a self taught painter and continue my design learning outside of the classroom.  I am currently looking for freelance positions as well as i am open to a solid position for a great company that I can assist with my ever growing skillset and hopefully increase my portfolio.</p>
