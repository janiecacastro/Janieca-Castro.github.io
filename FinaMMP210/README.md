For this final project i decided to try to create a temperature sensore for a fishtank or a tank surviving animal, 
that has special temperature rquirements for its survival. I did research and learned that different types of fish 
(fresh water, salt water) have not only different temperature requirements but also has different lighting requirements, 
some having to spend 8 hours a day to 18 hours a day in sunlight where as some fish thrive beter in mostly darkness. So the 
idea behind my project was to create a device that continuously checks the water temperature of the tank to make sure its set 
to the requirements of your specific species of fish. When the water gets too cold the sensor senda a popup notification to your 
phone to alert you it will be turning on the led light to help warm the tank. Another feature I would have added was to manually 
turn the lighton and off depending on the fish needs. One of the biggest challenges I faced doing this project was using the
processing application to connet to the arduino and to create the alert mechinism and to fix the code to stylize the alert box 
without distorting the message. I chose this project because i have family members who have continuosly have fish who die and 
spend lots of mney buying replacements and i beleiev one big issue is consistent and fast temperature control which I hoped 
this project idea will help eliminate the added costs of buying new fish and to help the surival rate of te fish and their offspring.
